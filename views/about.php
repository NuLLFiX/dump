<h3><?=$_CONFIG['site_name']?> FAQ</h3>
<dl>
    <dt>What is <?=$_CONFIG['site_name']?>?</dt>
    <dd><?=$_CONFIG['site_name']?> is just another so called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastebin">pastebin</a> website. That simply means that you can permanently store some fragment of programming code on <?=$_CONFIG['site_name']?> and share link to it to your collegues and friends (and enemies, if you will). Also you can store any text information, as well.</dd>
    </dd>
    <br>

    <dt>What if I want to highlight the syntax of the pasted fragment of code?</dt>
    <dd>Well. This is what the <?=$_CONFIG['site_name']?> does!</dd>
    <br>

    <dt>What is time-out for storing data on <?=$_CONFIG['site_name']?>?</dt>
    <dd>No time-out! The data will be on <?=$_CONFIG['site_name']?> untill I delete them manually or untill that will do the owner of the dump. Yep, I delete some dumps manually due to the abuse requests.</dd>
    <br>

    <dt>I do not want anybody can see my dump</dd>
    <dd>You can protect your dump with the password feature. When you create a new dump enter something into password field and nobody will have access to your snippet until he enters the right password.</dd>
    <br>

    <dt>How to contact site owner?</dt>
    <dd>Here is my mail: <a href="mailto:<?=$_CONFIG['admin_mail']?>"><?=$_CONFIG['admin_mail']?></a>
